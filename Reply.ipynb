Without going into a \\nlot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an \\nExpiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a \\ndate is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In \\naddition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a \\nmessage box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later \\ntime, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the \\nexpiration date becomes current).  \\n\\nThis request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of \\nrisks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue \\nwas addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.\\n\\nCan we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed and \\nyour feedback is appreciated.  \\n\\nThanks. \\n\\n\\nI work on the confirmation desk, reporting to Jeff Sorenson.  Please call me \\nif you have any questions or suggestions (X37580). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
